# SNEAKERZ

Sneakerz is a shoe store application. 
Actually... it is my firt attempt on developing an ecommerce.
My goal here is to start by the app (which is currently being developed) and later create a REST API to feed it. 

### How to run

Choose a folder and clone the project executing: 
```
git clone https://github.com/lliuti/sneakerz-mobile.git
```

enter the project folder (_cd sneakerz-mobile_)

to install all dependencies, run
```
yarn 
```

and to execute it:
```
yarn start
```

Also, keep in mind that I'm using expo and android studio to emulate the app.
